#Fractal Trees
Fractal trees are rendered in SVG using d3.js(<http://d3js.org/>).
Code is capable of producing fractal trees with any number of branches.
To change the maximum number of branches, change the variable, globalMaxBranchNo.

The code will automatically fill any screen size with trees of variables branch numbers.
